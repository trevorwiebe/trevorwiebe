ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Trevor Wiebe. My primary role is IT Director at Mercy Hospital, Inc. in Moundridge, KS. Additionally, I pursue a career as a freelance Android Developer during my evenings and weekends.

I delved into the fascinating world of computer programming at the age of 13, with Ruby as my first language. I soon discovered Android Development, a revelation that enabled me to create any application I envisioned, solidifying my passion for the field.

For any inquiries or correspondence, you may contact me at tw@trevorwiebe.com.

Thank you for visiting my profile.
