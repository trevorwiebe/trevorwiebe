ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Trevor Wiebe. I'm an Android Developer, enthused to learn!

I delved into the fascinating world of computer programming at the age of 13, with Ruby as my first language. I soon discovered Android Development, a revelation that enabled me to create any application I envisioned.  This was so exciting for me and settled me on a career path in programming!
